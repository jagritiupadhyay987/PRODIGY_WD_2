📌 Overview:
The Tic Tac Toe Web Application is a classic two-player game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the traditional paper-and-pencil game, allowing two players to compete in turns, placing X and O on a 3×3 grid. The application automatically checks for win conditions or a draw and provides an interactive, responsive interface suitable for all devices.

🎯 Objectives:
Implement the core logic of the Tic Tac Toe game.
Learn and apply DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic using JavaScript.
Create a clean, user-friendly UI with responsive design using HTML and CSS.

⚙️ Core Features:
Turn-Based Play- Automatically switches turns between X and O. Displays the current player's turn.
Win Detection- Checks all possible win combinations after every move.
Highlights the winning combination visually.
Draw Detection -Detects when the grid is full with no winner. Displays a draw message.
Restart Game - "Restart" or "Play Again" button to reset the game board.
Responsive Design - Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes: mobile, tablet, desktop.

🔍 How It Works:
The game grid is made up of 9 clickable cells (divs or buttons).
JavaScript listens for user clicks, updates the cell with the current player's symbol, and checks for a win or draw.
If a win is detected, the game stops and a message is displayed.
If a draw is detected, a draw message appears.
The board can be reset with a single click.

💡 Use Cases:
For learning and practicing JavaScript game logic.
Fun time-pass game for friends or kids.
Demonstration of event-driven programming and UI design skills.
